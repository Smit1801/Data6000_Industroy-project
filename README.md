Executive Summary
This report examines the use of behavioral data at the session level for predicting purchase intention in the e-commerce sector. For this purpose, the dataset of online shoppers' purchasing intention is utilized and predictive models such as logistic regression and gradient boosting are applied to increase conversion rates. Beyond bounce rates and page values, other features associated with proximity to special days are also included. Visual illustrations capture behavioral patterns in relation to the imbalance present in the dataset, where only 15% of the sessions result in actual purchases. The analysis addresses the gaps in previous studies by incorporating temporal variables alongside merging both categorical and continuous data, thereby creating refined, tailored marketing strategies based on real-time data.

Business Question:
How can the chance of a purchase be predicted in real time using session-based behavioral variables like page value, bounce rate, and visit duration?
